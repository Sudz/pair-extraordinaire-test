# pair-extraordinaire-test

## Purpose
This repository is created to unlock the 'Pair Extraordinaire' achievement on GitHub by creating a co-authored commit.

## Process for Unlocking Pair Extraordinaire Achievement

### Steps:
1. Create a new repository or use an existing one
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Make changes to a file (e.g., README.md)
4. Create a commit with a co-author using the 'Co-authored-by' trailer
5. Open a pull request from the feature branch to the main branch
6. Merge the pull request

### Co-authored-by Format
In the commit message, add the following at the end:
```
Co-authored-by: Name <email@example.com>
```

### Example Commit Message:
```
Add documentation for Pair Extraordinaire achievement

Co-authored-by: GitHub User <noreply@github.com>
```

## Automation Notes
- Use Git CLI or GitHub API to create co-authored commits programmatically
- The Co-authored-by trailer must be in the commit message body (not the title)
- Multiple co-authors can be added by including multiple Co-authored-by lines
- Achievement is unlocked when the co-authored PR is merged
