   - Look for "how to" questions or technical support requests

2. Read the question carefully and provide a helpful, detailed answer

3. Structure your answer professionally:
   - Address the user by @username
   - Provide clear, step-by-step solutions
   - Include code examples when relevant
   - Offer multiple approaches if applicable
   - Be friendly and encouraging

### Automation Strategy:

- **Finding Questions**: Use GitHub's search API to filter unanswered discussions
- **Target Topics**: Focus on areas where you have expertise (Docker, Python, CI/CD, etc.)
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Provide genuinely helpful answers rather than spamming
- **Response Time**: Answer newer questions for higher visibility and acceptance likelihood
- **Follow-up**: Monitor your answers and respond to follow-up questions

### Automation Notes:

- Cannot force users to accept answers - must provide genuine value
- Focus on repositories with active discussions
- Look for questions where original poster is still active (recent activity)
- Avoid closed/locked discussions
- Some discussions may never get an accepted answer
- Build reputation by consistently providing helpful answers

### API Workflow Example:

```bash
# Search for unanswered discussions using GitHub CLI
gh search discussions --limit 10 --json url,title,updatedAt --jq '.[] | "\(.title) - \(.url)"' is:unanswered

# Or use GitHub API directly
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  "https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=type:discussions+is:unanswered&per_page=10"
```
